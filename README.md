# Toxicity-Classifier

A simple web application to classify user-entered comments as hateful or not using TensorFlow.js and the @tensorflow-models/toxicity library.


This project uses TensorFlow.js and the @tensorflow-models/toxicity library to perform toxicity classification on user-entered comments. The web application provides a textarea for users to input comments, and a button to check whether the comment is classified as hateful or not.

Start the Node.js server:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Enter a comment in the textarea and click the "Check Toxicity" button to see the classification result.
